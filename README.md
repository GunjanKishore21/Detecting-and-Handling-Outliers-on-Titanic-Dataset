# Detecting-and-Handling-Outliers-on-Titanic-Dataset
Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the rest of the dataset. They can distort statistical analysis and negatively impact machine learning models. This project explores methods to detect, analyze, and handle outliers using the Titanic dataset, demonstrating their influence on predictive modeling.

Project Objectives
-Understand how outliers appear in real-world data.
-Apply statistical and visualization techniques to detect outliers.
-Implement various strategies to handle outliers.
-Analyze the impact of outlier removal and treatment on machine learning model performance.

Key Steps and Methodologies
1.Data Exploration & Preprocessing
-Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
-Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
-Visualized distributions using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

2.Outlier Detection Techniques
-Box Plot Analysis: Used to identify extreme values in numerical features.
-Standard Deviation Approach: Applied the 3-sigma rule to define outlier boundaries.
-Interquartile Range (IQR) Method: Defined outliers using the 1.5*IQR threshold.

3.Handling Outliers
-Capping & Flooring: Limited outliers within a defined range.
-Trimming: Removed extreme values to improve model robustness.
-Transformation Techniques: Applied log transformations and scaling to reduce skewness.

4.Impact on Machine Learning Models
-Evaluated how different outlier handling methods affect model accuracy and performance.
-Compared model scores before and after outlier treatment.

Key Takeaways:
-Outliers can distort feature distributions and mislead predictive models.
-Proper outlier handling techniques can significantly improve model reliability.
-Different machine learning models respond uniquely to outlier treatment, requiring tailored approaches.

This project provides an in-depth understanding of outlier analysis and equips data scientists with practical techniques to improve data quality and model performance.
